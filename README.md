## About

Created by [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/).

This software was initially funded by a generous [digital resources grant from the Kress Foundation](http://www.kressfoundation.org/grants/default.aspx?id=150). It was used to build the [PHAROS Image Database](https://github.com/jeresig/pharos-images).

Subsequently, continued work on this software was funded by the [Ritsumeikan University Arch Research Center](https://www.arc.ritsumei.ac.jp/en/index.html) to develop the [Ehon DB](https://ehon.dh-jac.net/), a database of Ehon (Japanese Picture Books).
